- Look at integrating into CEA weather helper
- fix the errors from poor connection
- correct the pressure problem (added supporting variables)
- make a better tutorial
- clean up the UI and the print statement so people understand that it is working
- fix the extra column problem from the solar radiation morph (was a misspelling of difhor using two "f"s)

- changed release mode. Now the .toml file just needs to be updated ot the next release version, the changes need to be brought to main,
    and a new release needs to be made in github so the action can run.
